# Credit Scoring

A binary classification machine learning algorithm for bank related applications. Potential real world use cases can be fraud detection or customer churn.

## Description

The purpose of this repository is to build a binary classifier that predicts the "Target" variable based on the other attributes provided. It can be used as a blueprint for a potential banking related application. Historical data is provided with this repository. 

The model is trained using the dataset called "dataset_train_1.csv" and tested using the dataset called "dataset_test_1.csv" in the `data` folder.

The business use case of this application aims to solve the following potential objectives:

1. Fraud detection
2. Customer churn
